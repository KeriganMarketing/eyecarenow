	Hi my name Is Ryan Shipes and I'm 26 years old. I’m a single father, a active fisherman, hunter and diver. And of course I'm a first responder. I have been a police officer with the City of Lynn Haven sense April 2015. I have worn glasses sense I was in Kindergarten. Another kid in my class actually got glasses only a couple weeks before me and I can remember thinking how I wanted glasses. After all my father wore glasses and there was no one else I wanted to be more like then him. 

	Well as I got older my opinion on glasses changed of course. Glasses were not the popular thing when I was growing up. When it came to playing sports, fishing with my father, or just trying to go to our beautiful beaches for a swim glasses didn’t help either. When I got into middle school I was able to get contacts and that helped out a lot. They were annoying some times and I could never wear them the entire day, but at least I didn’t have to worry about my glasses falling off while I was playing a game of basketball. Once I got into high school my contacts were a must. I got hired on at Shipwreck Island as a lifeguard for my first real job. And out there on those hot bright days you absolutely had to have sunglasses. Not just so you could see in order to do your job, but also to protect your eyes from the bright sun. 

	As I got a little older and became a young adult I quit wearing my contacts. I didn’t have the money for them and really they became such a hassle to put in every morning so I would just wear my glasses. However once I became a young father, some issues I have always had with having bad eyesight and wearing glasses became a bigger issue, and there was also some new issues. It has always been annoying waking up in the middle of the night to use the restroom or get a drink of water and have to search for my glasses to see. Or even just waking up in the morning and having to find them inorder to start my day. But the new addition of a young child just increased those mid night wake ups, and the importance of being able to see in order to give my son what he needed. The new issue I discovered was that little kids like glasses. They like to grab them, touch them, pull them off your face, sometimes on purpose sometimes on accident as they climb on your shoulders. So my glasses had many close calls falling off my face and almost being crushed. 

	My son is older now, 5 years old to be exact. And well we don’t have the same issues of him trying to grab them off my face that we had when he was a baby. But he is a 5yr old boy who wants to wrestle, play, and of course still climb on his daddy’s back and shoulders. So sometimes the glasses still get knocked off. 

	When I go out hunting its a tough choice for me. Do I attempt my contacts that may bug me to the point I cant sit still. Maybe during that crucial moment when I need to look down the sight of my bow or through my scope, will my contacts even focus. Will it be out of focus when whatever I’m hunting walks or fly’s up and I cant see it to even attempt to aim at it. Or do I wear my glasses that will fog up on my face in the cool morning weather. Of course I also have to worry about a glare on my glasses that might spook that buck that just walked up on me. I feel like its a loose loose situation sometimes. 

	Now I am a avid fisherman and my son is just like I was as a kid. He is the best fisherman on the planet just like I was as a kid, or at least that’s his story. It doesn’t matter what the weather is like, whats on TV, the time of day, or really anything else. If you give my son a option between fishing and anything else. He will pick fishing. It is his absolute favorite thing to do. When it comes to going fishing I really don’t have a choice in the matter though. I have to attempt to get my contacts in and deal with the discomfort because I have to have my sunglasses in with the bright Florida sun we have. I even missed a fishing trip one time because I struggled for 15 minutes to get my contacts in. Once I was able to get them in I rushed to the dock arriving 2 minutes to late. The boat had already left without me.  

	So scuba diving is another one of my joys in life and thanks to our lovely springs and beaches we have here I get to see some of the most beautiful sights in the entire world. Well I kinda get to see them. Once again my poor vision and use of contacts and glasses make things difficult. Obviously I cant wear my glasses underwater, and prescription masks are expensive. So I either attempt to wear my contacts and hope that I don’t loose one due to the water. Or I just go without and struggle to see my gauges. I don’t know if you know much about diving. But being able to read your gauges is kinda important. But thankfully its just difficult and not impossible for me to do. 

	Now to probably the most important reason on why I think I need lasik, my job. Now these reasons are not specific to me. These are things every police officer who wears glasses gets to experience on a day to day basis. In Florida it rains. It rains a lot and sometimes with little to no warning. Its hard to see out of glasses with rain drops all over them. And when you are in uniform you cant use your shirt to quickly wipe them off either. Hopefully you have a hat to protect your vision when you are on a call in the rain. 

	Maybe its not raining. Its a bright sunny day. You are out on patrol. And you cant see because its so bright outside. Maybe you can see out of your patrol vehicle and you see someone commit a offense and you do a traffic stop. You get out of your patrol vehicle and you want to and have to approach but you cant see the driver in that vehicle. You cant see if there are passengers. The sun is in your eyes. But you approach because that's your job. You get up to the vehicle and you cant tell if the driver is reaching for a gun to shoot you with or just grabbing there insurance card, because its so bright out and you are wearing glasses instead of sunglasses. These are realistic situations every officer faces every day.	

	Maybe your not on day shift. Its not bright out. And your are dispatched to a fight at a bar. You get there and you see 4 or 5 guys in a ball on the ground throwing punches kicking and yelling. You rush in to try and break up the fight before anyone gets seriously hurt. Backup hasn’t arrived yet. Somehow in the scuffle your glasses get knocked off your face. Now you cant see. You cant tell who is who. If they have a weapon or not. Is that another officer, or one of the brawlers. And when your glasses get broken on the ground during the scuffle you wont be able to see to write your report about that incident. Or when it goes to court be able to testify as to what you saw or who did what. Because you really couldn’t see it. 

	These are all reasons on why I want lasik. Its something I have wanted for a very long time. But just cant seem to save enough or even spend that kind of money on myself when there is a little boy who wants to go to the zoo, the aquarium, or Disney. I know there will be many people who put in for this. I can only imagine how tough of choice it will be to pick from so many deserving people. I just hope I get to be the lucky one you pick. Thank you.
